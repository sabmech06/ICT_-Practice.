# What ICT Means to Me

At first, I thought the interesting part about making a robot was the mechanical or the electrical part. That was until I found what ICT actually was. It is what gives the robot a brain and a voice. It's the code, the sensors, and the network that give the robot its most useful characteristics. Without these, the robot would be a hollow shell.

Another way to describe ICT is the fact that it is the "why" behind the "how". This fact fuels my curiosity to explore ICT. At last, it answers the question of what ICT means to me.
